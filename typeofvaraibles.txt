differnet type of variables :-
non static
static 
constant
readonly

static-if variable is declared with static modifier or if a var is declared in static block then the varaible is static whereas rest of the others are non static

non static variables are initialised only with the help of insatnce as instance is required for non static varaibel.

static members of a class does not require any insatnce for execution or iniialization whereas instance var are initiased only after creating the instance and every time the insatnce is created differently

in life cycle of a class static var are initialised only one time whereas insatcen variable are insiialised 0 times if no instance is created and n times if n instance are created

iniitialisation of insatnce(non static) var is associated with insatnce creation and constructor calling so inatnce var can be initialised by consturctor calling

we can also initialise static values through constrcutor but it will not create seperate values instead it will overides the previous value

3. if a variable is declared with keyword const we called it constant var and these constant var cannot be modified once after their decalation .

behaviour of constant var will be similar to var of static that is initialised one and only one time in the life cycle of a class and does not req insatnce of a class for accesing or initialising.

only diff between static and constant is static var cna be modified whereas consyant var cannot be modified 

4. readonly-var declared with keyword readonly is known as readonly and these var cannot be modified like constant after initialisation

its not compulsary to initialise the read only var at time of declaration as they can be initialised in a constrcutor

the behaviour of read only var will be similar to non static var that is initialised only after creating the instance 

only diff b/w/ read only and non static var is non static var can be mofied but read only cannot be mondified

const is fixed for whole class wheras read only is fixed for specific instance of a class
