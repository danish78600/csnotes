.net has provided multiple languages

constructor is a special method whihc is used to initialize variables inside a class
its name is same as classname

does not return any value-constructor

each and every class req this constructor if we want to create instance of the class

its responsibility of a programmer to define a constructor but if we dont do this then the compiler will implicitely define the constructor by the compiler

implicitly defined constructor are parameterless and are also called default constructor

implicitly defined constructors are public 

we can also define a constructor under the class if we do so we can call it as explicit constructor which can be both parameterised or parameterless

whenever instance of a class is created then the constructor is called implicitly and the varibles are assinged


in cs the variables we declared are public and we dont have control on them but to get the control over them we have to use encapsulation-by using getters and setters.
