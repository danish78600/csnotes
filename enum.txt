enum-is a user defined type so it is beter to define the enum directly under the namespace but it is also possible to define an enum in a class or structure also

enum are value type

public enum days{
mon,
tue,
wed
}

it is used when we want our user to select value from paricular list .

we cannot convert string to enum

to get access of enum values we can use 0 to get index 1st value directly but to get another values except 1st we have to use the following syntax-
enumname(value)
