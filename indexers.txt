it is a member of a class and with this our class works as a virtual array
we cannot apply on a class directly

modifier type this[parameter list]
{
get<stmts>
set<stmts>
}


indexer is defined on current class by this keyword

value is implicit variable that provide access to value provided by the user

but in indexers value is object so we have to typecast them to respective data types
