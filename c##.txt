class is a user defined type
structures is user defined type

structures in c# can contain most of the members what a class can contain such as field method constructor method properties

modifier struct  Name
{
define members here
}

difference between class and structure
class is a ref type whereas structure is a value type

1. struct(value type) is stored in stack and class(ref type) is stored in heap

2. we use classes for reperensting entities with larger volume data
but structures are used for representing smaller volume data(maximum 32 bit)

note-all predefined data types whcih come under ref type category(such as string or object) are classes whereas all the predefined data type under value type category (Int32).single,bool are structured


3. in class we have to use new keyword for instance creation but in structure new keyword is not mandatory

4. fields of a class can be initialized at the time of declaration whereas it is not possible with fields in structures
