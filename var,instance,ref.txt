variable of a class 
instance of a class
reference of a class

class-user defined type

int =100;
int i=100;

in first line of code memory will not be allocated as int is a blueprint and in 2nd line of code i is the copy of int blueprint

so class is also a data type and we need to create a copy of a class

instance is created with the use of new keyword which has its own memory and never shared with other instacne

first f=new first() //f is instance of class

OR

first f;  //variable declared of a class
f=new first() //instance created

memory allocation is done after instance creation

memory of different instances are created differently

first f1=new first();
first f2=f1;   //f2 is the reference of f1 as both will consume same memory as both will print the same output

ref of class- a copy of class which is initialised by using an exisitence insatance and ref of class will not have any memory allocation as they will use the same meory of instance .

ref of a class cna be called as a pointer to the instance and every modification we perform on the members using insatcne reflexts when we acces those members thru reference
