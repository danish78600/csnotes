strings are immutable which means that it cannot be modified

so if we concat a string then

string str="hello";
str1=str+" world";

the above will not concatenate but it will create 2 diff strings
hello
hello world

every time the memory gets allocated for the string

so if there are 100changes then it will cretae 100 different copies so to solve this problem we will use string builder as it is mutable

StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder("Hello");//16characters of memory is allocated but if we append more than 16 characters then the capacity will be doubled means in this case it will be from 16 to 32

sb.Append("world");
sb.Append("india");

5 characters are used by hello and space is reserved for 11 more characters

string builder is also very efficient
